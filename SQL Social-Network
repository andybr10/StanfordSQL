DELETE FROM Likes
WHERE ID1 IN (SELECT Likes.ID1 
              FROM Friend
              INNER JOIN Likes USING (ID1) 
              WHERE Friend.ID2 = Likes.ID2)

--Q3 For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. (This one is a bit challenging; congratulations if you get it right.)
--F1.ID1 is A, F1.ID2=F2.ID1 is B, F2.ID2 is C
